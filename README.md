# Python_SQL_Energy_LSTM
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for energy 
To enhance energy consumption forecasting, we can apply a more advanced AI model such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is especially powerful for sequential data like time series.

LSTM for Energy Consumption Forecasting
LSTM models are well-suited for time series forecasting because they can capture long-term dependencies in data.
